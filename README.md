# Welcome to the Linx Challenge repository!

## What should be developed

The challenge was to develop the layout of a landing page with a product grid and a newsletter form, following this [layout](https://xd.adobe.com/spec/4025e242-a495-4594-71d2-5fd89d774b57-3614/grid).

### Expected behavior

- For each product returned by the API, a product card with the respective information must be created in the product grid;
- By clicking the button Ainda mais produtos aqui! the next page of the API must be consulted, generating 8 more products in the existing grid, below the products already loaded by the first requisition;
- The newsletter form with the title Share the news must have its input fields validated according to the content;
